st.markdown(f"""
- **:primary[:material/search: Search and filter].** The database can be queried
  for individual TFs or multiple TFs, based on their UniProt accession and TF
  classification (genus number, genus name). Filter results down to a specific
  subset of TFs as per your interest.

- **:primary[:material/shopping_cart: Cart system].** The user can select TFs of
  interest, and add them to a "cart". This selection can be used to perform a
  more narrowed-down analysis on the patterns/motifs occurring in them.

- **:primary[:material/assignment: Per-TF analysis].** For a selected TF, the
  user can view its full sequence, highlight the patterns found in that
  sequence, visualize & plot the per-residue disorder propensity scores, and
  observe where each pattern falls relative to the DNA-binding domain and
  activation domain.

- **:primary[:material/area_chart: Interactive graphs and tables].** All plots,
  sequences and most tables are interactive, allowing for zooming into regions,
  toggle annotations, and sort rows.

- **:primary[:material/crown: Pattern ranking based on vagueness].** Patterns
  are ranked using a vagueness penalty metric, which penalizes motifs with
  high sequence variability (i.e. regexes that match many different amino
  acids). This promotes patterns that are more specific, and thus more
  biologically meaningful.

<!--
- **:primary[:material/text_compare: Cross-TF comparison].** TFs in the cart can
  be compared for shared patterns, their disorder characteristics, and whether
  their functional mapping (DBD vs. activation domain) is conserved. This
  supports cross-family and cross-class analysis.
-->

- **:primary[:material/regular_expression: Consensus motifs].** For patterns
  that occur in multiple TFs, {constants.APP_NAME} builds a consensus motif
  using Multiple Sequence Alignment ([MUSCLE](https://drive5.com/muscle5)) and
  displays it as a sequence logo. This can be executed on either the entire
  dataset of TFs, or on a custom selection by the user for a more nuanced
  analysis.

- **:primary[:material/download: Downloads].** Datasets, annotations, and
  analysis outputs (sequences, scores, matches, pattern frequencies) can be
  downloaded as CSV/TSV/FASTA for local processing or use in external workflows.

- **:primary[:material/link: Shareable URLs].** Specific TF Viewer and Pattern
  Explorer views can be shared as a direct link, so others can reproduce the
  same analysis. (Please note that cart contents are not currently encoded in
  shared URLs.)

1. Browse and discover available TFs
2. Analyze a particular TF in detail
3. Explore patterns/motifs across a selection of TFs or the entire dataset
